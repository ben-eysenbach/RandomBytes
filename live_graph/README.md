#live_graph

This is a python script for plotting real time data. I've used slight variations of this script for a number of projects, finding it to be a nice abstraction on top of the [Matplotlib animation API](http://matplotlib.org/api/animation_api.html).

This specific version was written to display sensor data for the [MIT Rocket Team](http://rocketry.mit.edu/).
